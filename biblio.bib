abstract = {We establish a link between the multisymplectic and the covariant phase space approach to geometric field theory by showing how to derive the symplectic form on the latter, as introduced by Crnkovic-Witten and Zuckerman, from the multisymplectic form. The main result is that the Poisson bracket associated with this symplectic structure, according to the standard rules, is precisely the covariant bracket due to Peierls and DeWitt.},

@article{Gotay1998a,
abstract = {This is the first paper of a five part work in which we study the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian structure of classical field theories with constraints. Our goal is to explore some of the connections between initial value constraints and gauge transformations in such theories (either relativistic or not). To do this, in the course of these four papers, we develop and use a number of tools from symplectic and multisymplectic geometry. Of central importance in our analysis is the notion of the ``energy-momentum map'' associated to the gauge group of a given classical field theory. We hope to demonstrate that many different and apparently unrelated facets of field theories can be thereby tied together and understood in an essentially new way. In Part I we develop some of the basic theory of classical fields from a spacetime covariant viewpoint. We begin with a study of the covariant Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, on jet bundles and multisymplectic manifolds, respectively. Then we discuss symmetries, conservation laws, and Noether's theorem in terms of ``covariant momentum maps.''},
