\section{Introduction: multisymplectic landscape at glance}
Let's briefly recall in what consists the multisymplectic approach to mechanics of field systems in order to understand its relationship with the covariant phase space approach.

\begin{itemize}
 \item the starting point is the \emph{configuration bundle} 
 	\begin{displaymath}
 		E = \left( \pi_{M,E} : E\rightarrow M \right)
 	\end{displaymath}
 	the object encoding the kinematics.
 \item from that we have constructed the \emph{I jet bundle} applying the jet functor to $E$ 
 	\begin{displaymath}
 	J^1E = \left( \pi_{J^1 M,E} : J^1 M\rightarrow M \right)
 	\end{displaymath} 
 	that is an affine bundle over $E$.
 \item Then, we considered other two vector bundle derived from the first jet:
 	\begin{displaymath}
 	J^{1 \TwistedAffine}E = \left( \pi_{J^{1 \TwistedAffine} M,E} : J^{1 \TwistedAffine} M\rightarrow M \right)
 	\end{displaymath}
	twisted affine dual of $J^1E$ called \emph{"extended multiphase space"}.
	\begin{displaymath}
	\vec{J}^{1 \TwistedLinear}E = \left( \pi_{J^{1 \TwistedLinear} M,E} : J^{1 \TwistedLinear} M\rightarrow M \right)
	\end{displaymath}
	twisted linear dual of $J^1 E$ called \emph{"standard multiphase space"}. \footnote{It can be seen as the dual bundle of the vector bundle $\vec{J^1E}$ linear model of $J^1E$}
	The first one can be also seen as an affine line bundle over the second one.
